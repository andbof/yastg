YASTG is Yet Another Space Trading Game, a text-based multiplayer space trading
game. While inspired by games such as Trade Wars, David Braben's Elite series
and the like, it ultimately stands on its own feet.

The project has a few (very long-term) goals:
	- Massively multiplayable, for a certain definition of "massively"
	- Extendable
	- Both human and computer controlled players
	- Fun for me!

The game is playable in the sense that you can connect and move around, but no
other stuff has been implemented. The rest will come when the Time is
Right(tm).

See the INSTALL file for installation and configuration instructions.
