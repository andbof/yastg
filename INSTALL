WHERE TO GET THE GAME

  The official repository is at github, see [1].

BASIC INSTALLATION

  Run "./configure" and correct any errors reported, such as installing
  missing packages. If "configure" doesn't exist, you've most likely cloned
  the git repository, and you need to run "./bootstrap" first (if bootstrap
  complains about missing files, you need to install autoconf and automake;
  see your distributions documentation on how to do that).

  Compile by running "make", followed by "sudo make install" to do a standard
  system-wide installation. If you want to install into another directory, such
  as into your home, run "./configure --prefix=/full/installation/path",
  followed by "make" and "make install".

CONFIGURING THE GAME

  yastg places its configuration files according to the XDG Base Directory
  Specification[2].

  Most stuff is configurable in the configuration files, which are most probably
  installed in /etc/xdg/yastg (or prefixed by whatever you specified using
  --prefix=, if you did so). Start by looking into yastg.conf; what you want to
  edit is either in that file or in another file listed there.

  Your personal configurations files will override the system-wide ones.
  Personal configuration files normally go in ~/.config/yastg, or in whatever
  directory specified by $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/yastg, if that variable is set.

  If you just want to launch a game, you don't have to change anything. The
  default settings will work fine.

  If you do want to change something, the configuration syntax should be fairly
  self-explanatory if you look in the respective configuration file. Worth
  knowing is:

  - Strings containing spaces must be enclosed within " and " (i.e.
    "this is one identifier"), but identifiers only one word long don't have
    to be.

  - Numbers can be entered in decimal (10), hexadecimal (0x0a), or scientific
    notation (1e1). Numbers should _not_ be quoted between " and ".

  - The left brace "{" cannot be preceded by a line break, and right brace "}"
    must be. This is standard K&R bracing, i.e. this is valid:

    identifier {
      key value
    }

    but this is NOT:

    identifier
    {
      key value
    }

    and NOT this either:

    identifier { key value }

  - Recommended indentation is one tab character per indentation level, but any
    amount of whitespace (including zero) is syntactically correct. You are
    recommended to have one whitespace character between identifiers and left
    curly brackets.

  - File names in configuration files are case sensitive, but keywords are not.

  - All identifiers are shortest-uniquely matched, i.e. if "Iron ore" is the
    only item beginning with an "i", just writing an "i" is enough to match it.

RUNNING THE GAME

  Launch the binary (yastg). It will start listening on port 2049 by default.
  Connect using your favourite client.
